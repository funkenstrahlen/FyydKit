## Reporting Issues

Please verify your issue or feature request actually refers to this API implementation and is not a problem with the fyyd API itself.

When reporting issues, please include:

* Which version of Xcode you're using
* Which OS or platform you're targetting
* Any stack trace or compiler error
* Code snippets that reproduce the behavior

Both bug reports and feature requests are welcome!

## Development

The coding style used is dictated by [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint). You can get SwiftLint by running `brew install swiftlint`. To run it, just clone the repository and run `swiftlint`. There is a `.swiftlint.yml` for lint configuration.

Prior to submitting a pull request, please verify that:

* The code compiles
* All tests pass
* SwiftLint reports no issues

## Thank You
